# USAGE:
# Copy and paste this file into the common/scripted_triggers folder of any mod that has EACP interoperability.
# Uncomment the definition for EACP_is_active_trigger below.
#
# If EACP is inactive, that trigger definition should be the one used by your mod, but if EACP is active, it should be
# overwritten with the definition below, allowing you to tell when EACP is active or not dynamically.

# EACP_is_active_trigger = {
#     always = no
# }
