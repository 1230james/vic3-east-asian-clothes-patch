# EACP moves all the EAC-added gene definitions into its own gene categories to promote mod compatibility and future-
# proofing against future vanilla content updates.

# Files here with the same names as vanilla ones are 100% clones of vanilla files. EAC overwrites them so we must
# overwrite it. Technically we don't *need* to do it (assuming EAC keeps up with the vanilla definitions), but this
# serves to ease future maintenance and acts to establish that this moving of EAC genes into custom categories is a
# workable concept.
