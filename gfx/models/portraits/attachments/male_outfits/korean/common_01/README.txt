This is a copy of the vanilla korean_common_01 meshes + textures as of 1.6.2.

This is here to enforce the vanilla assets being loaded because other mods require the vanilla one to be present, and
the guy who makes EAC is an absolute F'ing retard who decided that it would perfectly okay for him to come and REPLACE
THOSE ASSETS instead of just defining new pdxmeshes and entities

Imagine my shock when my clothing masks in another mod suddenly broke out of nowhere because of this inane BS
